# Tic-Tac-Toe-Artificial-Intelligence

A program that utilizes reinforcement learning and decision trees to train and refine a tic-tac-toe machine learning model to perfect the game. Three separate models trained on 100000, 5000000, and 15000000 iterations respectively (iteration count can be modified as needed).
